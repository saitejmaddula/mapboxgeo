# mapboxgeo
This project is based on the learning of use of API's to perform certain actions in our web app and also some of the Hasura API during my internship at Hasura which I was offered for being among Top 5% of the course Introduction to Modern Application Development(IMAD).The description of Gep Map API is as follows from the documentation:

The Mapbox Geocoding API performs two main tasks: forward geocoding and reverse geocoding. Forward geocoding converts text into geographic coordinates, for example, turning 2 Lincoln Memorial Circle NW into -77.050,38.889. Reverse geocoding converts geographic coordinates into a text description, for example, turning -77.050,38.889 into 2 Lincoln Memorial Circle NW.

I used to APT for the use of maps in my application and incorparted latest GUI of this version also in the app and this is a quickstart project for anyone who want to learn on using API's
